# Returns Terraform Plan summary
# This script should ONLY return plan summary to StdOut
#
# IMPORTANT: when using "returnStdout: true" in Jenkins, you must ensure ONLY your desired value is output to the
# pipeline. DO NOT use Write-Output, Write-Host, or output anything else into the pipeline.
#
# If you are using the returnStdout option of the powershell Pipeline step then only stream 1 will be returned,
# while streams 2-6 will be redirected to the console output if you enable stream pref to "Continue"
# eg: $VerbosePreference = "Continue"

    EXPLANATION: ^\s*\+
    ^ asserts position at start of a line
    \s* matches any whitespace character (equal to [\r\n\t\f\v ])
    * Quantifier - Matches between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)
    \+ matches the character + literally (case sensitive)
